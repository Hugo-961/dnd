			<p>You whisper magical words that antagonize one creature of your choice within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d4 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see. If the target can’t make this attack (for example, because there is no one within its reach or because its reaction is unavailable), the target instead has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

				<p>You call forth a spirit that embodies death. The spirit manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the reaper spirit stat block. The spirit disappears when it is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue the spirit any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell’s level appears in the reaper spirit stat block.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> The reaper can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.</p>
		<h5 class="caption">ACTIONS</h5>
		<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The spirit makes a number of Reaping Scythe attacks equal to half the level of the spell (rounded down).</p>
		<p><strong><em>Reaping Scythe. </em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 1d8 + 3 + the spell’s level necrotic damage.</p>
		<h5 class="caption">Bonus action</h5>
		<p><strong><em>Haunt Creature </em></strong> The spirit targets a creature it can see within 10 feet of itself and begins haunting it. While the target is haunted, you and the spirit sense the direction and distance to the target if it is on the same plane of existence as you. Additionally, if the target starts its turn within 10 feet of the spirit, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have the frightened condition until the start of the target’s next turn. The target remains haunted until it dies, the spirit disappears, or the spirit uses this action again.</p>
